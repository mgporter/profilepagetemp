        <p>I couldn't help but include one snazzy effect when the user opens a project. The page 'bubbles' out and is replaced by the project description. This effect actually has quite a few moving parts, since it is not usually possible to clip (or delete) a portion of an element starting from the inside. See if you can figure out how it's done! As far as hooks, this effect does involve the relatively little-used useLayoutEffect hook to get accurate measurements of dom elements (complicated greatly by the presence/absence of the scrollbar!).</p>
